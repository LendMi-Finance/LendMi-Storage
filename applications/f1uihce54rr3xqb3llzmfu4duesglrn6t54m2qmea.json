    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Sentinel-2 mission is a land monitoring constellation of two satellites that provide high resolution optical imagery and provide continuity for the current SPOT and Landsat missions. The mission provides a global coverage of the Earth's land surface every 5 days, making the data of great use in ongoing studies. This dataset is the same as the Sentinel-2 dataset, except the JP2K files were converted into Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs). Additionally, SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog metadata has were in a JSON file alongside the data, and a STAC API called Earth-search is freely available to search the archive. This dataset contains all of the scenes in the original Sentinel-2 Public Dataset and will grow as that does. L2A data are available from April 2017 over wider Europe region and globally since December 2018.",

    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "Less than 1 year",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, Australia (continent), Antarctica",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3)",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "1.f02813403 UK\r\n2.f02814393 US\r\n3.f02830321 VN\r\n4.f02837226 UK\r\n5.f02864300 US",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
