## IPFS Ecology Revenue Protocol
It has a variety of products including VFIL lending mining funds.LendMi opens up mining and coin circles through DEFI to generate higher coin-based returns for investors.

LendMi collects FIL in the form of central lending, lends FIL to large nodes (large mining pools) for mining, and rewards for output are then distributed to investors. Because output is stable, investors can be guaranteed fixed income. On the other hand, in order to ensure the validity of the node pledge assets, the community elects large nodes (high value) and requires the node pledge node private key to ensure control of the node (control can be verified by the miner’s signature).

LendMi now supports HECO and BSC Main Chain Ecology, with deposit exceeded 900,000 coins and TVL once exceeded $150 million.
